# winshell-lang-ja_JP
Japanese language file (with complete translation) for winshell 3.

(Checked with version 3.3.2.6)

You can use this language file by replacing the original ja_JP.txt to the one you can download from here.

It is the same file which used to be downloadable from my homepage ( http://redmine.nnnnn.me/projects/winshell ).
